/**
 * <p>Instances of this type are used to construct an invocation from the client to the server-side entity.  Each method
 * modifies the state of the instance and then returns itself so that several of these methods can be used in a chain.
 * Note that the invocation doesn't actually get sent to the server until {@link #invoke()} is called.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The acknowledgement configurations can be complex so a high-level description of them and their meanings is
 * provided here, with greater detail in the relevant methods, below:</p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li><b>SENT</b> means that a message has become "in-flight", meaning that it will be re-sent in the event of a
 *  server restart or fail-over to passive. Note that this message is not generally useful to applications</li>
 *  <li><b>RECEIVED</b> if requested, will only return from invoke() once the global order of this message (relative to
 *  others depending on RECEIVED) has been determined for the entire stripe. This means that every server in the stripe
 *  has received the message, and agreed upon the order. Note that RECEIVED is the only optional ack (the others always
 *  go over the wire, but only optionally influence client-side waiting). This should be requested in cases where
 *  knowing the global order of messages (preserved for restart or fail-over) is important</li>
 *  <li><b>COMPLETED</b> is observed by the client when the active has finished running the invoke and returned the
 *  result. Calling get() on the returned InvokeFuture will, by default, wait until RETIRED but the InvocationBuilder
 *  can be configured to make the get() return only once COMPLETED has been received. Note that this only relates to
 *  what has happened on the active: it is possible for the client to see the COMPLETED ack before any passives have
 *  seen the message</li>
 *  <li><b>RETIRED</b> is the final acknowledgement, after which time the message will not be re-sent in the event of
 *  restart or fail-over. It represents the point where the message has completed on all servers in the stripe and also
 *  any messages it created to defer its retirement (see {@link IEntityMessenger}) have also completed on all servers in
 *  the stripe</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Requested acks generally only apply to when the {@link #invoke()} method will return but some messages explicitly
 * change the behavior of the returned {@link InvokeFuture#get()} (to either wait on COMPLETED or RETIRED).</p>
 * 
 * @param <M> An {@link EntityMessage}
 * @param <R> An {@link EntityResponse}

   *  <li>Any passive servers are substantially lagging behind the active.  This is because the COMPLETED arrives
   *  immediately after the active has finished the invoke of the message, whereas RETIRED comes in after all servers
   *  have finished the invoke.</li>
   *  <li>The message deferred its retirement to a message it created (see {@link IEntityMessenger}).  In those cases,
   *  the RETIRED only arrives once both the initial message and any of these messages it created have completed on all
   *  servers.</li>
   * </ol>
   * 
   * <p>Note that, due to re-sends, it is possible to see the COMPLETED ack, multiple times, before seeing the final
   * RETIRED (which only happens once).</p>
   * 
   * <p>If {@link get()} is blocking until RETIRED, it will return the result included in the <b>final</b> COMPLETED
   * ack.  If it is only blocking until COMPLETED, it will return the result included in the <b>first</b> COMPLETED ack
   * (ignoring the results from any later COMPLETED acks which arrive).</p>
   * 
   * <p>In some applications, it may give a client-side performance benefit to only wait for the first COMPLETED
   * ack, before returning from the get().  This method allows the client to change this behavior.</p>
   *

   * in response to restart of fail-over events.</p>
